Palindrome Test:

This program comes with a PalindromeTest class (PalindromeTest.java) and a Palindrome Detector class (PalindromeDetector.java). 
It uses a stack (which can take char's), called MyCharStack.java.  
To run, compile all three files. The input file must be input at the command line, there is only one command line argument needed: the file name. 
The program will catch user errors at the command line. It prints out the palindromes found in the file to the console. 

Expression Tree: 

This program comes with the Expression Tree class (ExpressionTree.java), and the String Stack class (StringStack.java). It uses the stack 
build the expression tree. To run, compile both files. Run the code, and enter a valid postfix expression. The output will print 
to the console. The program catches ArrayOutOfBoundsExceptions, which occur when the user does not enter a valid postfix expression.

BinarySearchTree

This program is a single file. Compile it, then run it. The main method is a tester that runs through the methods in the class,
checking that they work.
