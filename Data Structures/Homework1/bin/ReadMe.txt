Each program is totally contained within its own file
	Problem 1: MakeChange.java
	Problem 2: Exercise2_8.java
To run each program, compile, and run.
	Program 1 will prompt the user to enter a change value at runtime
	Program 2 win simply run, and display a graph. The window and graph sizes 
	are based on runtime averages on my computer
			Because of the input sizes the sum of times & average time must be 
			computed as longs; ints are not of sufficient size for such large
			inputs; input size 6400000 returns unexpectedly long timed
			results due to the increased time casting from such a 
			large long to an int takes when inputting graphing values.
			Overall, the relative efficiency of each algorithm is still 
			apparent by looking at the graph.
